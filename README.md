# Rainfall-Prediction-
In this project, I will be implementing a predictive model on Rain Dataset to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia.The Dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations of different locations in Australia. By the end of this project, you will be able to build a predictive model.

# Objectives: 
Design a predictive model with the use of machine learning algorithms to forecast whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia.

# Data Source:
The dataset is taken from Kaggle and contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.

# Dataset Description:

Number of columns: 23
Number of rows: 145460
Number of Independent Columns: 22
Number of Dependent Column: 1
